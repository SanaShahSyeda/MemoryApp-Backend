## üêû Builder Notation Error [Lombok] [Builder] [Annotation]

### Code

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MemoryApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // 1. Create User using builder
        User user = User.builder()
            .email("johndoe@example.com")
            .password("securepassword")
            .build();

        // 2. Create Board using builder
        Board board = Board.builder()
            .title("My First Board")
            .user(user)
            .build();

        System.out.println(board.getTitle() + " " + board.getUser());
    }
}
```

### Error Message

```java
java: cannot find symbol
  symbol: method builder()
```

### Cause

The `@Builder` annotation was not working because the Lombok dependency version was missing in `pom.xml`.

### Solution

- Added the latest version of Lombok in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
  <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
  <version>1.18.38</version>
</dependency>
```

- Enabled annotation processing in IntelliJ IDEA:
  - Navigate to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors`
  - Check: "Enable annotation processing"

- Add the `@Builder` annotation to the class:

```java
@Builder
public class User {
    ---
}
```

### Related Concepts

Lombok annotations, annotation processing, Builder design pattern.

**Note:** This issue was discovered while testing the `User` and `Board` classes.

## üêû ToString Missing [Lombok] [ToString]

### Error Message

```java
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin\java.exe"
My First Board com.spring.memory.entities.User@710726a3
```

### Cause

The object printed its memory reference because the `toString()` method was not overridden.

### Solution

- Add `@ToString` annotation to the class:

```java
@ToString
public class User {
    ---
}
```

- To exclude sensitive fields like `password`, use:

```java
@ToString(exclude = "password")
public class User {
    private String email;
    private String password;
}
```

### Related Concepts

Lombok annotations, `Object.toString()` override behavior.

**Note:** This issue was identified while printing `User` data in the `Board` class.
